# Environment Configuration Files

Here are many of the configuration files I tend to keep between different instances.

## Win32 Specific:
- cmder/user-aliases.cmd
  - helpful aliases for a much nicer command line experience.

## vscode
- settings.json
  - my preferred settings for Visual Studio Code.
